## Problem 1 ##

The following statements may or may not be correct. For each statement, if it is correct, provide a short proof of correctness. If it is incorrect, provide a counter-example to show that it is incorrect. **In the following, assume that the graph G = (V, E) is undirected and connected.** Do not assume that all the edge weights are unique unless stated.

### 1 ###

Suppose we implement the disjoint-sets data structure using union-by-rank but not path compression. Then, there is a sequence of $\leq$≤ n union and ≤ m find operations on n elements that take Ω(m log n) time.
